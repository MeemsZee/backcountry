Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Predictions: the more simulations, the longer it will take for the program to predict winners by precent.  The result of the times isn't linear though

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 

It appears that the predictions are pretty much the same from 10000 simulations and on.
