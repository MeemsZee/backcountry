        <p>Never in my wildest imagination would I have thought my life would become nomadic. I have always been a big city girl and always felt at home in the sea of chaos that is New York City. The fast paced life was routine and the daily micro stresses that came along with it toughened me up and prepared me for many of life’s mishaps and adventures. Even when I leave the city for an extended period of time, when I come back, I am able to seamlessly merge back into my old live. Everytime I go back home to visit, I am back into alert mode and I’m not going to lie, I love it.  The buzz and excitement of being in such a metropolis embraces me like a long lost relative. </p>
        <p>My current life started when the pandemic hit and what made New York City so great ceased to exist. The prospect of being stuck in my apartment by myself for weeks didn’t appeal to me so my friends and I immediately booked Airbnbs because now that we were all remote, why not the hell not? I get to pick a select few friends to hang out with until the pandemic is over and we all go back to our normal lives.  After a few months of staying in Airbnbs, a friend of mine told me that he bought a trailer in Colorado and asked if I would like to join him.  Without hesitation, I said “YES!”, and ever since then my life has been filled with numerous great adventures that I’ve never dreamed I would go on. What was supposed to be a couple of weeks away from the office turned into never going back. </p>
        <p>I’ve created this website to combine all my trailer adventures and passions into one place.  Hopefully, it inspires someone to also explore the world in a moving home or help people who just started their adventure with some tips that would make their lives easier.  We have gone through many mishaps so you don’t have to! One of my two passions in life is rock climbing, so one of the criteria of where we visit is if there is outdoor climbing nearby.  The other is cooking.  Though the kitchen in the trailer is less than half the size of my kitchen in NYC, it has everything I need to make many of the meals I want. If it didn’t have what I needed, that just means I have to be creative and find another way to make my food amazing. As I would say to many things in life, challenge accepted.</p>
